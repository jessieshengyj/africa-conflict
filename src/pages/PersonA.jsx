                        The heatmapâ€™s color gradient clearly emphasizes high-fatality alliances, while size encoding effectively conveys alliance stability through event counts. The circle plot

                        illustrating how shifts in actor alliances correspond to changes in conflict intensity. The country dropdown selector efficiently filters all three charts simultaneously,
                        improving focus when analyzing specific regions. The year slider adds flexibility by dynamically adjusting the heatmap to explore alliances within distinct periods.</p>
                        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong>The stability indicatorâ€™s blue gradient may appear too subtle, making it harder to distinguish differences in alliance frequency â€” a stronger
                        color gradient or larger dots could improve visibility. Additionally, the trend line may become cluttered when displaying multiple actor types, especially if some groups contribute
                        minimally to total fatalities. Introducing a toggle to filter dominant actors or applying a smoothing technique could improve clarity. </p>

                        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The combination of the polar chart and bar chart effectively reveals seasonal and overall trends in conflict events.
                        The polar chartâ€™s radial layout highlights cyclical patterns in conflict events, making it particularly useful for identifying seasonal surges in
                        conflict intensity. The use of distinct colors for different actor types ensures clarity, while the facet grid layout efficiently organizes the polar
                        charts by year, making temporal comparisons intuitive. The bar chart complements this by summarizing the total number of events for each actor type,
                        providing a clear comparison of actor dominance. The bi-directional filtering feature allows users to explore patterns by event type, country, or month,
                        improving focus and enabling detailed exploration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> While the polar chart effectively emphasizes seasonal trends, its circular layout may reduce precision when comparing
                        exact event counts. This may limit the ability to detect subtle month-to-month variations. The bar chart, although clear, lacks temporal context;
                        incorporating a time filter or trend visualization alongside the bar chart could provide a more comprehensive view of actor behavior over time.
